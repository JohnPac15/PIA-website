## App Functionality

### Homepage
The homepage provides basic information about the site including basic insurance information, the team, an FAQ section, contact information, and the ability to login or register.  Once a user is logged in, the homepage will provide links to their dashboard and logout functions.

### Dashboard
A user has access to their dashboard after successfully logging in.  The dashboard (HAS THIS FUNCTIONALITY)

### Access (Login, Register, Logout)
Policy owners must login to see their policies on the dashboard.  After logging in, a cookie is created providing the user access to their dashboard.  If a user does not have an account, they can register for a new account and will have access to their dashboard after successfully registering.  If logged in, the user will have access to the logout function which will close their session.  Once the session is closed the user must login again to see their dashboard.  If a user is an admin, their session cookie will provide access to the admin page.

### Admin
Page for admins to review policy owners and make changes as needed.  This page currently has basic functions.  Additional functions such as updating policies, changing policy owner data, and adding/removing policy owners and admins.
