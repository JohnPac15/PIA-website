### Access (Login, Register, Logout)

Policy owners must login to see their policies on the dashboard. After logging in, a cookie is created providing the user access to their dashboard. If a user does not have an account, they can register for a new account and will have access to their dashboard after successfully registering. If logged in, the user will have access to the logout function which will close their session. Once the session is closed the user must login again to see their dashboard. If a user is an admin, their session cookie will provide access to the admin page.
